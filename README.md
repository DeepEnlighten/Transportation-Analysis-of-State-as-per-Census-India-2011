# Transportation-Analysis-of-State-as-per-Census-India-2011
Model share analysis for Transport system using India Census 2011
Using MS Excel, The data focused on four categories: Urban areas, Highway Density, Urbanization, and Percentage of Population Below Poverty Line (BPL) in India. Here are the key findings:

1. Urban Areas:
Urban areas are densely populated regions with both residential and commercial zones. They provide various infrastructures and services to cater to the concentrated population. Urban areas serve as centers for economic, cultural, and social activities and generally have higher population densities compared to rural areas. The data defines urban areas based on two criteria: (a) Places with a Municipality, Corporation, Cantonment, or Notified Town Area, and (b) Other places that meet specific criteria, including a minimum population of 5,000, at least 75% of the male working population engaged in non-agricultural activities, and a population density of at least 400 persons per square kilometer.

2. High and Low-Density States:
Based on the data, the data identifies states with high and low population densities. High-density states include NCT Delhi, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, Bihar, West Bengal, Kerala, and Uttar Pradesh. Conversely, low-density states comprise Meghalaya, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Arunachal Pradesh.

3. Highway Density:
The data also examines the highway density in different states. States with high highway density are Chandigarh, NCT Delhi, Nagaland, Tripura, Goa, Manipur, and Haryana. On the other hand, states with low highway density include Karnataka, Odisha, and Arunachal Pradesh.

4. Urbanization:
Urbanization levels were analyzed for various states. States with high urbanization include NCT Delhi, Chandigarh, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Goa, Mizoram, and Tamil Nadu. Conversely, states with low urbanization levels are Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, Odisha, Assam, and Bihar.

5. Percentage of Population Below Poverty Line:
The data explores the percentage of the population below the poverty line in different states. States with high poverty levels include Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam, Rajasthan, and Odisha. In contrast, states with low poverty levels are Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sikkim, Goa, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, and Kerala.

6. Modal Share and Trip Length Analysis:
The data also analyzes modal share and trip length preferences based on population density, highway density, and urbanization levels. Based on that, overall on foot mode and Bicycle mode choose more in corresponding density distribution, increases with all mode.

Overall, the data provides insights into the characteristics and variations of urban areas, highway density, urbanization levels, and poverty percentages in different states. The modal share and trip length analysis suggest some correlations based on the mentioned factors, but further details and conclusions are not available in the provided summary.
